1. How are graceful degradation and service workers related?

Graceful degradation and service workers are related in the way that they work together to benefit user experience. If something goes wrong with a website, these concepts protect the system from completely failing. For example, say a user loses or has weak connection, service workers allow for graceful degradation since they can offer limited functionaility while the user is offline. Essentially, service workers enable graceful degradation to occur.
